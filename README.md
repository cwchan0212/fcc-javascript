<h2>Palindrome Checker</h2>

<p align="justify">Return **true** if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return **false**.</p>

<p align="justify">A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.</p>

<p align="justify">Note: You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.</p>

<p align="justify">We'll pass strings with varying formats, such as racecar, RaceCar, and race CAR among others.</p>

<p align="justify">We'll also pass strings with special symbols, such as **2A3*3a2**, **2A3 3a2**, and **2_A3*3#A2**.</p>
